Device & Control Configurations:

Detects connected hardware:

Steering wheels + pedals (force feedback optional)

Fighting → joystick/gamepad mapping

Smart Wizard can repair configs or switch input modes per game.

Accuracy & Validation Standards:

GameProfiles must match TeknoParrot’s XML schema exactly.
