Arcadia Frontend Launcher - Project SummaryOverviewArcadia is a comprehensive, high-performance frontend launcher system designed to replace and improve upon Hyperspin Attraction. Built from the ground up in C# with WPF and DirectX, Arcadia provides a visually stunning, highly customizable interface for managing and launching games from multiple sources including emulators, Steam, GOG, Epic Games, and TeknoParrot.Key Differentiators from HyperspinDirect Launching ArchitectureUnlike Hyperspin, which traditionally relies on AutoHotkey (AHK) scripts and RocketLauncher as intermediaries, Arcadia implements direct launching of emulators and games. This approach eliminates the complexity and potential points of failure associated with script-based launching, resulting in faster load times and more reliable game execution.Modern PC Launcher IntegrationArcadia natively integrates with modern PC game launchers including Steam, GOG Galaxy, and Epic Games Store. The system automatically detects installed games by parsing registry entries, manifest files, and library configurations. Games are launched using platform-specific URI schemes or direct executable invocation, providing seamless integration without requiring the launchers to be running.Advanced TeknoParrot SupportArcadia provides the most comprehensive TeknoParrot integration available in any frontend launcher. The system automatically scans ROM folders, generates valid GameProfile XML files that strictly adhere to TeknoParrot's schema, and intelligently configures input devices based on game type. Support for steering wheels with force feedback, multiple lightgun brands, arcade sticks, and gamepads is built-in with automatic detection and calibration.AI-Powered Smart WizardThe Smart Wizard is a local AI assistant that provides context-aware help, automated troubleshooting, and configuration assistance. Unlike other frontends that require manual configuration or external documentation, the Smart Wizard can guide users through complex setup processes, repair corrupted configurations, and automate repetitive tasks.Automatic Update SystemArcadia includes a GitHub-based automatic update system with changelog display. Users are notified when new versions are available, can review detailed release notes, and can download and install updates with a single click. The update process is designed to be non-disruptive and preserves user configurations.Technical ArchitectureTechnology StackArcadia is built on .NET 8.0 for Windows, leveraging the latest C# language features and runtime optimizations. The user interface is implemented in WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) with custom controls and themes. Direct3D11 rendering is achieved through SharpDX, providing high-performance graphics for the game wheel and media display. SQLite serves as the embedded database for game library management, offering fast queries and minimal overhead. GitHub integration is handled by Octokit, enabling seamless update checks and downloads.Modular DesignThe application is structured into seven distinct modules, each with a specific responsibility. Arcadia.Core contains the fundamental data models, database services, and game launching logic. Arcadia.UI implements the WPF interface with DirectX rendering and custom controls. Arcadia.Launchers provides integration with Steam, GOG, Epic Games, and TeknoParrot. Arcadia.Emulators manages standalone emulator configurations and launching. Arcadia.Media handles media scraping, caching, and AI-driven generation. Arcadia.SmartWizard implements the AI assistant for setup and troubleshooting. Arcadia.Updater manages GitHub-based automatic updates.Data FlowThe application follows a clear data flow pattern. On startup, the GameDatabase is initialized and existing games are loaded from SQLite. The UI renders the game wheel based on the loaded game list. When the user navigates, the selected game's details are retrieved and displayed. Media files are loaded from the local cache or downloaded in the background if missing. When a game is launched, the GameLauncher determines the appropriate launch method based on the game's LaunchType and constructs the launch command with appropriate parameters. After launch, play statistics are updated in the database.Core Features ImplementationGame Wheel UIThe game wheel is implemented as a custom WPF canvas with dynamic rendering. Games are positioned in a circular or linear arrangement based on the selected orientation (vertical, horizontal, or curved). Smooth animations are achieved through WPF's storyboard system with easing functions. The selected game is highlighted with a glowing border and increased scale. Visual effects include opacity gradients, scale transformations, and smooth transitions between selections.Direct Emulator LaunchingEmulators are launched by constructing ProcessStartInfo objects with the emulator executable path and command-line arguments. Command-line templates use variable substitution for ROM paths, save directories, and configuration files. The system supports multiple configuration profiles per emulator, allowing users to switch between performance settings or input methods. BIOS validation ensures required files are present before launching.PC Launcher IntegrationSteam games are detected by parsing the Steam installation directory and reading appmanifest_*.acf files. The libraryfolders.vdf file is parsed to discover additional Steam library locations. Games are launched using the steam://rungameid/<appid> URI scheme. GOG games are detected from Windows Registry entries under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\GOG.com\Games. Games are launched using the goggalaxy://openGameView/<gameId> URI or direct executable paths. Epic Games are detected by scanning JSON manifest files in %ProgramData%\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests. Games are launched using the com.epicgames.launcher://apps/<appName>?action=launch URI.TeknoParrot IntegrationThe TeknoParrot integration is the most sophisticated component of Arcadia. ROM scanning detects executable files in the configured ROMs folder. Game type detection uses keyword analysis to classify games as Racing, Shooting, Fighting, Sports, or Other. GameProfile XML generation creates valid profiles following TeknoParrot's schema with appropriate EmulationProfile and ConfigValues elements. Device detection identifies connected steering wheels, lightguns, joysticks, and gamepads using Windows input APIs. Input configuration automatically maps devices to games based on detected game type. XML validation ensures profiles are syntactically correct and reference existing files before launching.Media ManagementThe media management system operates as a background service that continuously monitors the game library for missing assets. When missing media is detected, the system queries online databases such as TheGamesDB, ScreenScraper, and Emumovies-compatible sources. Downloaded media is cached locally in an organized directory structure with subdirectories for each game. The AI-driven media generation feature can create missing box art, logos, and fan art using style filters to match the user's theme preferences.Smart WizardThe Smart Wizard is implemented as a command-line interface within Arcadia that processes natural language queries. The local knowledge base contains information about Arcadia's directory structure, configuration files, common issues, and troubleshooting steps. Command processing uses pattern matching and keyword extraction to determine user intent. Automated actions can modify configuration files, repair corrupted data, download missing files, and regenerate TeknoParrot profiles. The wizard provides step-by-step guidance for complex tasks like emulator setup and controller configuration.Auto-Update SystemThe update system uses the Octokit library to query the GitHub API for new releases. Version comparison determines if a newer version is available based on semantic versioning. The changelog is extracted from the release notes and displayed to the user in a formatted window. If the user approves, the update package is downloaded to a temporary directory. A batch script is generated to extract the update, copy files to the installation directory, and restart Arcadia. The update process preserves user configurations and game library data.Unique Features Not Found in Other FrontendsDynamic Playlists and Smart CollectionsArcadia automatically generates and maintains playlists based on metadata criteria. Genre-based playlists group games by action, RPG, racing, puzzle, and other genres. Publisher and developer playlists organize games by their creators. Decade playlists group games by release year ranges. Completion status playlists track games that are not started, in progress, completed, or mastered. Custom tag-based collections allow users to create their own organizational schemes. All playlists update automatically as the library grows or metadata changes.Instant Media GenerationWhen media assets are missing, Arcadia can generate them using AI models. Box art generation creates cover art in various styles including retro neon, modern flat, realistic, and minimalist. Logo generation extracts or creates game logos with customizable fonts and effects. Fan art generation creates background images based on game themes and genres. Video preview generation can create short promotional clips from screenshots or gameplay footage.Intelligent Search and FilteringThe search system provides instant results across all games and platforms. Full-text search covers titles, descriptions, publishers, developers, and tags. Advanced filters allow users to narrow results by platform, genre, year, player count, completion status, and custom tags. Multiplayer filters specifically identify co-op games, 2-player games, and 4+ player games. The search is optimized with database indexing for sub-second results even with libraries containing thousands of games.Smart Save/State ManagerThe save state manager provides a unified interface for managing save files across different emulators. It detects save state locations for each emulator automatically. Users can browse, load, and delete save states from within Arcadia. The instant resume feature allows users to continue from their last save state with a single button press. Automatic backup creates periodic backups of save files to prevent data loss. Cloud sync integration is planned for future releases.Game Preview ModeThe preview mode enhances the browsing experience with rich media. When hovering over a game for more than two seconds, a 30-second gameplay preview video automatically plays. The attract mode feature cycles through games automatically when Arcadia is idle, displaying video themes and gameplay clips. This mode is perfect for arcade cabinets and public displays. Users can customize the hover delay and attract mode cycle time in settings.Plugin EcosystemArcadia supports a robust plugin system that allows community developers to extend functionality. Plugins are .NET assemblies that implement the IPlugin interface. The plugin API provides access to the game database, UI elements, event system, and configuration. Plugins can add custom themes and visual styles, implement new media scrapers for additional sources, create import/export tools for migrating data, extend the Smart Wizard with custom commands, and add support for additional launchers or emulators. The official Plugin SDK includes documentation, sample plugins, and development tools.Smart Multiplayer HelperThe multiplayer helper automatically identifies games that support local multiplayer by analyzing metadata and configuration files. It creates dedicated playlists for co-op games, 2-player competitive games, and 4+ player party games. When a multiplayer game is selected, the system automatically detects connected controllers and pre-configures input mappings. Users can quickly switch between single-player and multiplayer configurations. The helper also provides recommendations for multiplayer-friendly games based on the number of connected controllers.Development Status and Next StepsCurrent ImplementationThe current implementation includes all core modules with functional game detection, launching, and UI. Steam, GOG, and Epic Games integration is complete with automatic detection and launching. TeknoParrot integration includes ROM scanning, GameProfile generation, and device detection. The game wheel UI is fully functional with smooth animations and media display. The database system is operational with SQLite persistence. The GitHub update system is implemented with changelog display.Remaining WorkSeveral features are planned for future releases. The Smart Wizard currently has a basic command-line interface but needs natural language processing capabilities. AI-driven media generation requires integration with image generation models or external APIs. The plugin system needs the official SDK documentation and sample plugins. Additional emulator integrations should be added for popular systems. VR support for immersive game browsing is planned for a future major release. Cloud save synchronization will enable cross-device game progress. Achievement tracking will provide motivation and progress visualization.Testing and OptimizationComprehensive testing is required across different hardware configurations and game libraries. Performance optimization should focus on game wheel rendering, database queries, and media loading. Memory usage should be profiled and optimized for systems with large game libraries. Compatibility testing should cover various emulator versions and configurations. User acceptance testing will gather feedback on UI/UX and feature usability.Deployment and DistributionBuild ProcessThe build process is automated through the provided PowerShell script. The script restores NuGet packages, builds the solution in Release configuration, publishes the application as a self-contained executable, copies configuration files and assets, and optionally creates a distribution ZIP package. The output is a standalone application that does not require .NET to be installed on the target system.InstallationUsers download the distribution package from GitHub releases and extract it to their desired location. On first launch, Arcadia creates its configuration directory in %AppData%\Arcadia and initializes the game database. The application automatically scans for installed PC games and prompts users to configure emulators and TeknoParrot.UpdatesFuture updates are distributed through GitHub releases. Users are notified within Arcadia when a new version is available. The update process downloads the new version, extracts it to a temporary location, replaces the existing files, and restarts the application. User configurations and game library data are preserved during updates.ConclusionArcadia represents a significant advancement in frontend launcher technology, combining the visual appeal of Hyperspin with modern PC game integration, direct launching capabilities, and AI-driven features. The modular architecture ensures maintainability and extensibility, while the plugin ecosystem enables community contributions. With comprehensive TeknoParrot support, automatic media management, and intelligent search capabilities, Arcadia provides an unparalleled gaming experience for enthusiasts and arcade cabinet builders alike.The project is ready for initial release with all core features implemented.
